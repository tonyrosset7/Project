0,DECAB-LSTM: Deep Contextualized Attentional Bidirectional LSTM for cancer hallmark classification,"The great number of online scientific publications on cancer research makes large scale data mining possible. The hallmarks or characteristics of cancer can be used to distinguish cancerous cells from normal cells. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to organize and categorize a sea of scientific articles into the corresponding hallmarks by predicting whether or not they contain the information of interest. In the past, many research works tended to employ traditional machine learning methods that characterize feature engineering. Deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is only a limited number of work with a focus on deep learning techniques for the task of cancer hallmark text classification. To advance this task, a novel neural architecture DEep Contextualized Attentional Bidirectional LSTM (DECAB-LSTM) was proposed, capable of learning to attend to the valuable information in a sentence by introducing contextual attention mechanism. We also investigated the effect of a good word embedding for the cancer hallmark text classification. We trained our model on a benchmark dataset and reported the accuracy, f score, and AUC metrics. Compared to several baselines like Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Networks, fastText, etc., the proposed model have achieved state-of-the-art performance over baselines, demonstrating its great potential in the empirical application to cancer research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Knowledge-Based Systems,0,@ great number of online scientific publication on cancer research make @ scale data mining possible @ @ hallmark @ characteristic of cancer @ @ used to distinguish cancerous cell @ normal cell @ therefore @ is extremely necessary to organize and categorize a sea of scientific article @ @ corresponding hallmark by predicting whether @ not @ contain @ information of interest @ in @ past many research work tended to employ traditional machine learning method @ characterize feature engineering @ deep learning-based method @ achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of natural language processing @ nlp @ task @ however @ is only a limited number of work @ a focus on deep learning technique @ @ task of cancer hallmark text classification @ to advance @ task a novel neural architecture deep contextualized attentional bidirectional lstm @ decab-lstm @ wa proposed capable of learning to attend to @ valuable information in a sentence by introducing contextual attention mechanism @ @ @ investigated @ effect of a good word embedding @ @ cancer hallmark text classification @ @ trained @ model on a benchmark dataset and reported @ accuracy f score and auc metric @ compared to several baseline like logistic regression support vector machine convolutional neural network fasttext etc @ @ proposed model @ achieved state-of-the-art performance @ baseline demonstrating @ great potential in @ empirical application to cancer research @ @ b @ v @

17,Using argument mining for legal text summarization,"Argument mining, a subfield of natural language processing and text mining, is a process of extracting argumentative text portions and identifying the role the selected texts play. Legal argument mining targets the argumentative parts of a legal text. In order to better understand how to apply legal argument mining as a step toward improving case summarization, we have assembled a sizeable set of cases and human-expert-prepared summaries annotated in terms of legal argument triples that capture the most important skeletal argument structures in a case. We report the results of applying multiple machine learning techniques to demonstrate and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different methods to identify sentence components of these legal argument triples. © 2020 The Authors, Faculty of Law, Masaryk University and IOS Press.",2020,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,0,argument mining a subfield of natural language processing and text mining is a process of extracting argumentative text portion and identifying @ role @ selected text play @ legal argument mining target @ argumentative part of a legal text @ in order to better understand @ to apply legal argument mining a a step toward improving case summarization @ @ assembled a sizeable set of case and human-expert-prepared summary annotated in term of legal argument triple @ capture @ @ important skeletal argument structure in a case @ @ report @ @ of applying multiple machine learning technique to demonstrate and analyze @ advantage and disadvantage of different method to identify sentence component of @ legal argument triple @ @ author faculty of law masaryk university and io @ @ 
24,Efficient text summarization method for blind people using text mining techniques,"Owing to the phenomenal growth in communication technology, most of us hardly have time to read books. This habit of reading is slowly diminishing because of the busy lives of people. For visually challenged people, the situation is even worse. In order to address this impedes, we develop a better and more accurate methodology than the existing ones. In this work, in order to save the efforts for reading the complete text every time, we modify the Weighted TF_IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm to summarize books into relevant keywords. Then, we compare the modified algorithm with that of the existing algorithms of TextRank Algorithm, Luhn’s Algorithm, LexRank Algorithm, Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA). From the comparative analysis, we find that Weighted TF_IDF is an efficient algorithm to automate text summarization and produce an effective summary which is then converted from text to speech. Thus, the proposed algorithm would highly be useful for blind people. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,International Journal of Speech Technology,0,owing to @ phenomenal growth in communication technology @ of u hardly @ time to read book @ @ habit of reading is slowly diminishing @ of @ busy life of people @ @ visually challenged people @ situation is even worse @ in order to address @ impedes @ develop a better and more accurate methodology @ @ existing @ @ in @ work in order to save @ effort @ reading @ complete text every time @ modify @ weighted tf idf @ term frequency inverse document frequency @ algorithm to summarize book @ relevant keywords @ @ @ compare @ modified algorithm @ @ of @ existing algorithm of textrank algorithm luhn s algorithm lexrank algorithm latent semantic analysis @ lsa @ @ @ @ comparative analysis @ find @ weighted tf idf is @ efficient algorithm to automate text summarization and produce @ effective summary @ is @ converted @ text to speech @ thus @ proposed algorithm would highly @ useful @ blind people @ @ science @ medium llc part of @ nature @ 
28,MAGPEL: an autoMated pipeline for inferring vAriant-driven Gene PanEls from the full-length biomedical literature,"In spite of the efforts in developing and maintaining accurate variant databases, a large number of disease-associated variants are still hidden in the biomedical literature. Curation of the biomedical literature in an effort to extract this information is a challenging task due to: (i) the complexity of natural language processing, (ii) inconsistent use of standard recommendations for variant description, and (iii) the lack of clarity and consistency in describing the variant-genotype-phenotype associations in the biomedical literature. In this article, we employ text mining and word cloud analysis techniques to address these challenges. The proposed framework extracts the variant-gene-disease associations from the full-length biomedical literature and designs an evidence-based variant-driven gene panel for a given condition. We validate the identified genes by showing their diagnostic abilities to predict the patients’ clinical outcome on several independent validation cohorts. As representative examples, we present our results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and prostate cancer. We compare these panels with other variant-driven gene panels obtained from Clinvar, Mastermind and others from literature, as well as with a panel identified with a classical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) approach. The results show that the panels obtained by the proposed framework yield better results than the other gene panels currently available in the literature. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,Scientific Reports,0,in spite of @ effort in developing and maintaining accurate variant database a @ number of disease-associated variant @ still hidden in @ biomedical literature @ curation of @ biomedical literature in @ effort to extract @ information is a challenging task due to @ @ i @ @ complexity of natural language processing @ ii @ inconsistent use of standard recommendation @ variant description and @ iii @ @ lack of clarity and consistency in describing @ variant-genotype-phenotype association in @ biomedical literature @ in @ article @ employ text mining and word cloud analysis technique to address @ challenge @ @ proposed framework extract @ variant-gene-disease association @ @ full-length biomedical literature and design @ evidence-based variant-driven gene panel @ a given condition @ @ validate @ identified gene by showing @ diagnostic ability to predict @ patient clinical outcome on several independent validation cohort @ a representative example @ @ @ @ @ acute myeloid leukemia @ aml @ breast cancer and prostate cancer @ @ compare @ panel @ @ variant-driven gene panel obtained @ clinvar mastermind and others @ literature a well a @ a panel identified @ a classical differentially expressed gene @ degs @ approach @ @ @ @ @ @ panel obtained by @ proposed framework yield better @ @ @ @ gene panel currently available in @ literature @ @ author @ s @ @

30,Automatic paper writing based on a RNN and the TextRank algorithm,"Academic research is crucial to the development of science and technology and is an important factor that affects national strength. When writing an academic research paper, a rhetorical structure is typically used to present the paper's ideas, but this task is quite difficult for junior researchers. To solve this problem, some studies have adopted text mining to assist with the writing, but the existing methods still require human intervention to generate sentences. Recently, due to the increasing maturity of deep learning technology and the ability to address the problem of automatic text generation, progress has been made in this area. The highly complex deep learning operations can correctly generate sequences and find correlations between sequences. When a user provides a few keywords and key sentences, the proposed algorithm can generate an introduction section for the user. The results show that the generated introduction is more coherent, clearer, and more fluent than existing summarization methods. In addition, the method proposed in this study improves the accuracy compared with traditional text extraction methods. The manuscript produced by this study has been evaluated to show that the study can produce a comprehensive introduction compared with previous studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Applied Soft Computing Journal,1,@ research is crucial to @ development of science and technology and is @ important factor @ affect national strength @ @ writing @ @ research @ a rhetorical structure is typically used to @ @ @ @ s idea @ @ task is quite difficult @ junior researcher @ to solve @ problem some study @ adopted text mining to assist @ @ writing @ @ existing method still require human intervention to generate sentence @ recently due to @ increasing maturity of deep learning technology and @ ability to address @ problem of automatic text generation progress ha @ made in @ area @ @ highly complex deep learning operation @ correctly generate sequence and find correlation @ sequence @ @ a user provides a @ keywords and key sentence @ proposed algorithm @ generate @ introduction section @ @ user @ @ @ @ @ @ generated introduction is more coherent clearer and more fluent @ existing summarization method @ in addition @ method proposed in @ study improves @ accuracy compared @ traditional text extraction method @ @ manuscript produced by @ study ha @ evaluated to @ @ @ study @ produce a comprehensive introduction compared @ previous study @ @ b @ v @ 
31,Good and bad events: combining network-based event detection with sentiment analysis,"The huge volume and velocity of media content published on the Web presents a substantial challenge to human analysts. In prior work, we developed a system (network event detection, NED) to assist analysts by detecting events within high-volume news streams in real time. NED can process a heterogeneous stream of news articles or social media user posts, combining text mining and network analysis to detect breaking news stories and generate an easy-to-understand event summary. In this paper, we expand the NED event detection and summarisation approach in two ways. First, we introduce a new approach to named entity disambiguation for tweets, which contain minimal information due to brevity. Second, we apply sentiment analysis techniques to documents associated with a detected event to characterise the event as either broadly ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ based on media portrayal. Our expansion focuses on Twitter streams since Twitter has become an important news dissemination platform and is often the site where emerging events are first seen. To test the extended methodology, we apply it here to three data sets related to political elections in the UK and the USA. The addition of sentiment analysis to the NED event detection methodology improves the insight gained by the user by allowing quick evaluation of the perceived impact of an event. This approach may have potential applications in domains where public sentiment is relevant to decision-making around events, such as financial markets and politics. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,Social Network Analysis and Mining,0,@ huge volume and velocity of medium content published on @ web @ a substantial challenge to human analyst @ in prior work @ developed a system @ network event detection ned @ to assist analyst by detecting event within high-volume news stream in real time @ ned @ process a heterogeneous stream of news article @ social medium user post combining text mining and network analysis to detect breaking news story and generate @ easy-to-understand event summary @ in @ @ @ expand @ ned event detection and summarisation approach in @ way @ first @ introduce a @ approach to named entity disambiguation @ tweet @ contain minimal information due to brevity @ second @ apply sentiment analysis technique to document associated @ a detected event to characterise @ event a either broadly positive @ negative based on medium portrayal @ @ expansion focus on twitter stream since twitter ha become @ important news dissemination platform and is often @ site @ emerging event @ first seen @ to test @ extended methodology @ apply @ @ to three data set related to political election in @ uk and @ usa @ @ addition of sentiment analysis to @ ned event detection methodology improves @ insight gained by @ user by allowing quick evaluation of @ perceived impact of @ event @ @ approach may @ potential application in domain @ public sentiment is relevant to decision-making around event @ a financial market and politics @ @ author @ s @ @ 
32,Reducing efforts of software engineering systematic literature reviews updates using text classification,"Context: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are frequently used to synthesize evidence in Software Engineering (SE), however replicating and keeping SLRs up-to-date is a major challenge. The activity of studies selection in SLR is labor intensive due to the large number of studies that must be analyzed. Different approaches have been investigated to support SLR processes, such as: Visual Text Mining or Text Classification. But acquiring the initial dataset is time-consuming and labor intensive. Objective: In this work, we proposed and evaluated the use of Text Classification to support the studies selection activity of new evidences to update SLRs in SE. Method: We applied Text Classification techniques to investigate how effective and how much effort could be spared during the studies selection phase of an SLR update. Considering the SLRs update scenario, the studies analyzed in the primary SLR could be used as a classified dataset to train Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. We conducted an experiment with 8 Software Engineering SLRs. In the experiments, we investigated the use of multiple preprocessing and feature extraction tasks such as tokenization, stop words removal, word lemmatization, TF-IDF (Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency) with Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines as classification algorithms. Furthermore, we configured the classifier activation threshold for maximizing Recall, hence reducing the number of Missed selected studies. Results: The techniques accuracies were measured and the results achieved on average a F-Score of 0.92 and 62% of exclusion rate when varying the activation threshold of the classifiers, with a 4% average number of Missed selected studies. Both the Exclusion rate and number of Missed selected studies were significantly different when compared to classifier which did not use the configuration of the activation threshold. Conclusion: The results showed the potential of the techniques in reducing the effort required of SLRs updates. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Information and Software Technology,0,context @ systematic literature review @ slrs @ @ frequently used to synthesize evidence in software engineering @ se @ however replicating and keeping slrs up-to-date is a major challenge @ @ activity of study selection in slr is labor intensive due to @ @ number of study @ must @ analyzed @ different approach @ @ investigated to support slr process @ a @ visual text mining @ text classification @ @ acquiring @ initial dataset is time-consuming and labor intensive @ objective @ in @ work @ proposed and evaluated @ use of text classification to support @ study selection activity of @ evidence to update slrs in se @ method @ @ applied text classification technique to investigate @ effective and @ much effort could @ spared @ @ study selection phase of @ slr update @ considering @ slrs update scenario @ study analyzed in @ primary slr could @ used a a classified dataset to train supervised machine learning algorithm @ @ conducted @ experiment @ software engineering slrs @ in @ experiment @ investigated @ use of multiple preprocessing and feature extraction task @ a tokenization stop word removal word lemmatization tf-idf @ term-frequency inverse-document-frequency @ @ decision tree and support vector machine a classification algorithm @ furthermore @ configured @ classifier activation threshold @ maximizing recall hence reducing @ number of missed selected study @ @ @ @ technique accuracy @ measured and @ @ achieved on average a f-score of @ and of exclusion rate @ varying @ activation threshold of @ classifier @ a average number of missed selected study @ @ @ exclusion rate and number of missed selected study @ significantly different @ compared to classifier @ @ not use @ configuration of @ activation threshold @ conclusion @ @ @ showed @ potential of @ technique in reducing @ effort required of slrs update @ @ b @ v @
